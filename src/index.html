  <h2>Get To Know Me...</h2>
    <p>I have enough spunk and passion for an entire village(we are talking huge). My background is pretty diverse
    which has garnished my perspective on things with multiple views. In one line my friends would say I am a <q>mommy of twins
      that has a black-belt in taekwondo and loves herself a good craft beer</q>. But that would be skimming the surface.</p>

  <h2>Future me is pretty cool<h2>
    <p>As you might have guessed, I am working towards becoming a phenomenal <span>frontend developer</span>. There is nothing
      more magical than knowing exactly what you want to do in life and I have found that! Some tools I plan on incorporating as
      a phenomenal frontend dev are:</p>
      <div class="tools">
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>Sharing My Journey Via Blog</h2>
  <p>I wouldn't know half of what I know today if it weren't for such a helpful community that is tech. Everything has been at my disposition
    usually with just one click of a button. The least I can do is share my journey as I make my way to greatness. I plan to one day look back
    at my blog, see my very first post and think <q> I have come so far</q>.
