# web-project

I am creating a personal website where I can showcase my skills, share what I am learning, and practice while building my personal site. I have started by building the front-end aspect of my site since that is what I learned first but ultimately, I want to also build the back-end. I am currently learning Ruby, which I will use for back-end. 
I am open to suggestions, critiques (whether constructive or not) and please fork it! 

Thank you
