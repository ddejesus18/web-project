# web-project

I am creating a personal website where I can showcase my skills, share what I am learning, and practice while building the site. 

I started creating this site after learning HTML & CSS. I started out on my text editor and moved over to Codepen because it was a friendlier environment. While building the site, I started the jQuery course on Codecademy and included a quick jQuery effect on my header. 

This site was intended to be my playground. It allowed me to learn ne things, bring out my inner creative and showed me that I can design a wonderful site. This is my first take at a personal site and I am really happy with the results. I am even more excited about the future changes I will make to it as I expand my Front-End skills.

I am open to suggestions, critiques (whether constructive or not) and please fork it! 

Thank you
